# Documentation

All documentation has been moved to the application directory for better organization and co-location with the code.

## 📚 Documentation Location

All documentation is now located in `apps/design-system/`:

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../apps/design-system/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Overall architecture and project structure
- **[Component System](../apps/design-system/src/design-system/components/README.md)** - Component organization and usage
- **[Theme System](../apps/design-system/src/design-system/themes/README.md)** - Theme system documentation
- **[App Routes](../apps/design-system/app/README.md)** - Route structure and patterns
- **[App Configuration](../apps/design-system/config/README.md)** - Site configuration
- **[App Hooks](../apps/design-system/hooks/README.md)** - Application hooks
- **[Shared Utilities](../apps/design-system/lib/README.md)** - Utility functions

## Why Moved?

Documentation is now co-located with the code it describes, making it easier to:
- Find relevant documentation when working on a specific area
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Maintain context-specific documentation at the appropriate level
