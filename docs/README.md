# Documentation

All documentation has been moved to the application directory for better organization and co-location with the code.

## 📚 Documentation Location

All documentation is now located in `apps/v4/`:

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../apps/v4/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Overall architecture and project structure
- **[COMPONENT_SYSTEM.md](../apps/v4/src/design-system/components/COMPONENT_SYSTEM.md)** - Component organization and patterns
- **[SHOWCASE_SYSTEM.md](../apps/v4/src/design-system/components/SHOWCASE_SYSTEM.md)** - Component showcase system
- **[CATEGORY_SYSTEM.md](../apps/v4/src/design-system/components/CATEGORY_SYSTEM.md)** - Component categorization
- **[THEME_SYSTEM.md](../apps/v4/src/design-system/themes/THEME_SYSTEM.md)** - Theme system documentation
- **[DESIGN_SYSTEM_PAGE.md](../apps/v4/app/DESIGN_SYSTEM_PAGE.md)** - Design system showcase page

## Why Moved?

Documentation is now co-located with the code it describes, making it easier to:
- Find relevant documentation when working on a specific area
- Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- Maintain context-specific documentation at the appropriate level
